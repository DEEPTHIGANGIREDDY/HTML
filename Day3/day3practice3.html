<i><b>Shivaji (Shivaji Shahaji Bhosale;</b></i> Marathi pronunciation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Marathi">[ʃiʋaːd͡ʒiˑ bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]</a>; c. 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680<sup>[5]</sup>), also known as Chhatrapati Shivaji,<sup>[6][7]</sup>
was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.<sup>[8]</sup> Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adil_Shahi_dynasty">Adilshahi sultanate</a> of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijapur>Bijapur</a> 
which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhatrapati">Chhatrapati</a> of his realm at Raigad Fort.<sup>[9]</sup>

The states of <mark>Satara and Kolhapur came into being in 1707</mark>, because of the succession dispute over the royalty. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahu_I">Shahuji</a>, the heir apparent to the Maratha empire, 
captured by the Mughals at the age of nine, remained their prisoner at the death of his father Sambhaji, <q>the elder son of Shivaji the founder of the Maratha Empire</q>, in 1689. 
<u>The dowager Maharani Tarabai</u> <mark>(wife of Rajaram I)</mark> proclaimed her son Shivaji II, as <ins>Chhatrapati under her regency</ins>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire">Mughals</a> released Shahu under certain conditions in 1707, 
and he returned to claim his inheritance. He defeated the regent at the Battle of Khed and <del>established himself at Satara</del>, forcing her to retire with her son to Kolhapur. 
By 1710 two separate principalities had become an established fact. Shivaji II and Tarabai were soon deposed by the other wife of Rajaram, Rajasbai. She installed her own son, 
Sambhaji II, as the new ruler of Kolhapur. Sambhaji II signed the Treaty of Warana in 1731 with his cousin Shahuji to formalize the two separate seats of Bhonsle family.<sup>[2]</sup>
