	This article is about the Sanskrit epic. For other uses, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata_(disambiguation)">Mahabharata (disambiguation).</a>

The Mahābhārata <a href="">(/məˌhɑːˈbɑːrətə, ˌmɑːhə-/ mə-HAH-BAR-ə-tə, MAH-hə-;<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Sanskrit:</a> महाभारतम्, Mahābhāratam, pronounced [mɐɦaːˈbʱaːrɐt̪ɐm]) is one 
of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India revered in Hinduism, the other being the Rāmāyaṇa.<sup>[5]</sup> It narrates the events and aftermath of the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurukshetra_War">Kurukshetra War</a>, a war of succession between two groups of princely cousins, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaurava">Kauravas</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandava">Pāṇḍavas.</a>

It also contains philosophical and devotional material, such as a discussion of the four "goals of life" or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puru%E1%B9%A3%C4%81rtha">puruṣārtha</a> (12.161). Among the principal works 
and stories in the Mahābhārata are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a>, the story of Damayanti, the story of Shakuntala, the story of Pururava and Urvashi, the story of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitri_and_Satyavan">Savitri and Satyavan</a>, the story of Kacha and Devayani, the story of Rishyasringa and an abbreviated version of the Rāmāyaṇa, often considered as works 
in their own right.

Traditionally, <mark>the authorship of the Mahābhārata is attributed</mark> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyasa">Vyāsa.</a> There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers. 
The bulk of the <b>Mahābhārata</b> was probably compiled between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE, with the oldest preserved parts not much older than 
around 400 BCE.<sup>[6][7]</sup> The <ins>text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period</ins> (c. 4th century CE).<sup>[8][9]</sup>

The Mahābhārata is the longest epic poem known and has been described as "the longest poem ever written".[10][11] Its longest version consists of over 
100,000 śloka or over 200,000 individual verse lines (<q>each shloka is a couplet</q>), and long prose passages. 
<blockquote>At about 1.8 million words in total, the Mahābhārata is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined, or about four times the length 
of the Rāmāyaṇa.<sup>[12][13]</sup></blockquote>
W. J. Johnson has compared the importance of the <b>Mahābhārata</b> in the context of world civilization to that of the Bible, the Quran, the works of Homer, 
Greek drama, or the works of William Shakespeare.[14] Within the Indian tradition it is sometimes called the fifth Veda.<sup>[15]</sup>
